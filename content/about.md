Hi, I am Aaditya. I am a computer engineering undergraduate studying at the [Institute of Engineering](https://ioe.edu.np), [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np). I am currently in 7th semester.
I worked as part time backend developer at [Clamphook](https://clamphook.com). I used [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), python microframework and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Currently, I am engaging in the [FuseMachine](https://fusemachines.com/)'s AI fellowship.
